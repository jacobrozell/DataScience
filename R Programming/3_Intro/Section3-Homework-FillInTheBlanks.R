#Solution
#Calculate Profit As The Differences Between Revenue And Expenses
profit <- revenue - expenses
profit

#Calculate Tax As 30% Of Profit And Round To 2 Decimal Points
tax <- round(0.30 * profit, 2)
tax 

#Calculate Profit Remaining After Tax Is Deducted
profit.after.tax <- profit - tax
profit.after.tax

#Calculate The Profit Margin As Profit After Tax Over Revenue
#Round To 2 Decimal Points, Then Multiply By 100 To Get %
profit.margin <- round(profit.after.tax / revenue, 2) * 100
profit.margin

#Calculate The Mean Profit After Tax For The 12 Months
mean_pat <- mean(profit.after.tax)
mean_pat

#Find The Months With Above-Mean Profit After Tax
good.months <- profit > mean_pat
good.months

#Bad Months Are The Opposite Of Good Months !
bad.months <- !good.months
bad.months

#The Best Month Is Where Profit After Tax Was Equal To The Maximum
best.month <- profit.after.tax == max(profit.after.tax)
best.month

#The Worst Month Is Where Profit After Tax Was Equal To The Minimum
worst.month <- profit.after.tax == min(profit.after.tax)
worst.month

#Convert All Calculations To Units Of One Thousand Dollars
revenue.1000 <- round(revenue / 1000, 0)
